Thank you for downloading this project.

:List of common errors:

If the font is ugly. Install MS Gothic true type font. The font file can be found at the very end of the maps.lmu 

If you are getting a "The RPG Maker 2003 Runtime Package is not present or not registered." error.
Visit this link. 'http://2drpg.com/d/Rm2k3_RPG.zip' and download and install the 2k3 package. 

If you got a "division by 0" error. This is a rare bug that lies in a flaw in 2k3's coding. It happens 
at random and simply restarting and crossing your fingers seems to be the only way to fix it. It's
really rare though.

If you get a "DERR_Unsupported Error" visit this link.

If you are stuck walking in a direction without actually pressing any of the keys, run the file named "kbdreset.exe."
It resets your registery for the keyboard and unsticks your keyboard inputs. 

Using "Auto" combat when fighting the snails in zone 3 can cause issues with their combat feature. If a snail fails to
come out of its shell in any situation, simply run from combat.


============= WARNING! =================
If you are hearing impaired. Do not select hard mode puzzle, for it has musical and location hearing based puzzles. 
If harsh language, slurs, acts of suicide and drug abuse disturb you please proceed into this game with hefty
caution. If you are prone to seizures due to flashing images, be warned as many combat animations involve
bright flashes of white.
